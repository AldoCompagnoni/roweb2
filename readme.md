Welcome to the new (October 2017) website for the rOpenSci project. Our old [website](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb) is now archived and all new content should be added to this repository. For any issues with the site including typos or rendering issues, please file an issue or send a pull-request. The site automatically deploys once pull requests are merged.

Once you've drafted your blog post, you can preview locally using Hugo. See [technical notes](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2#technical-stuff-) section for installation instructions. 

4. Send a pull request from your fork. Netlify will start building the new version of the site within seconds and you can preview you changes to make sure everything looks as intended. Otherwise push additional fixes till things look right.

5. Tag a rOpenSci staff member to review your PR (@stefaniebutland, @sckott, @jeroen, or @karthik)

### Installation requirements

There are no requirements to simply add a post/fix and push to GitHub for a render preview on a pull request. However, if you wish to preview the site locally, you must install Hugo.

#### Installing Hugo for local preview

The current version of `hugo` on the server uses is defined in [netlify.toml](netlify.toml). To install hugo locally:

```
brew install hugo
```

Then run `hugo serve` in the repo directory to start a local server on [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)


#### Updating page templates 

For other website issues and updates, see [advanced-theming](advanced-theming.md)
