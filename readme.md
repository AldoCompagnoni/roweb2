# New rOpenSci Website

Some notes on how this is set up.

## Run locally

The current version of `hugo` on the server uses is defined in [netlify.toml](netlify.toml). To install hugo locally:

```
brew install hugo
```

Then run `hugo serve` in the repo directory to start a local server on [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)

## Compiling CSS

CSS is defined in a series of `pcss` files that you need to compile into CSS when modified.
You need a specific postcss stack defined in [package.json](themes/ropensci/static/package.json).
If you don't have npm yet, run e.g. `brew install node`. 

```sh
cd themes/ropensci/static/
npm install .
npm run css
```
