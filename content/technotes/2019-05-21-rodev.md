We strive for high quality in [our suite of packages](/packages/), in practice via a [system of software peer review](/software-review/), and via [packaging guidelines that keep growing](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/). There is therefore a risk of increasing the work load of package authors, who already have a lot on their plate. To avoid that, we try to not only document how to do things in our dev guide; we also try to have automated tools at hand to recommend to authors.

Inspired by [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/), we've started work on our specific helpers for rOpenSci package authors, [`rodev`](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/rodev/). In this note, we'll present the helpers it contains at the moment, and ask for the feedback of you as an rOpenSci package author.

### Setup

To use `rodev`, you'll need to install it from GitHub,

```r
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/rodev")
```

and then, go to the package project you want to test it on. Indeed, `rodev` works on the active project [as defined by `usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/#usage).
